                <h2>A Tribute to Our Past</h2>
                <p>In 1932, Brooklyn based shirt-maker Max Gitman left New York and opened the Ashland Shirt & Pajama Company in the coal mining town of Ashland, Pennsylvania.</p>
                <p>With his two sons, Alfred & Sheldon, he ran the factory as a contract shop until 1978 when the Gitman Bros. brand was born.</p>
                <p>Today, we are one of the few remaining shirt-makers with all our production based in the USA.</p>
                <p>Launched in 2008, Gitman Vintage pays tribute to the brand’s rich heritage with a unique interpretation of the past.</p>
                <p>Each season, we return to the company archives and select fabrics from old line books, tweaking them with dyes and reworking patterns, scale and construction.</p>
                <p>Our philosophy has always been to bridge the old and the new.</p>
                <p>So we continue to honor the importance of the button down Oxford and classic chambray while continually pushing the boundaries of</p>
                <p>a traditional shirt-based collection with everything from pineapple prints to Japanese indigos and rip-stop nylon.</p>
                <p>Through each iteration, our commitment to quality is as important today as it was when Max Gitman and his sons first set up shop in Ashland.</p>
                <p>Many of our sewers are third and fourth generation shirt makers and their collective expertise is always our most valuable asset.</p>
